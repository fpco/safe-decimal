# Changelog for safe-decimal

## 0.2.1

* Add `arithError`
* Add `RoundHalfToZero` and `RoundHalfFromZero` rounding strategies.
* Conversion from `Scientific` normalizes the input and is more resilient to unbounded
  computation for bounded `Decimal` result.

## 0.2.0

* Add `Arith` monad and corresponding functions.
* Make rounding dependent on precision type (extra type argument to the `Round` type class)
* Rename `RoundFloor` to `RoundDown` (with `Floor` as synonym)
* Rename `Truncate` to `RoundToZero` (with `Truncate` as synonym)
* Fix conversion `fromRational` to throw `Underflow` instead of rounding. Without this fix
  there was unexpected behavior on negative numbers.
* Addition of `scaleUp` and `scaleUpBounded`
* Addition of `toFixedDecimal`, `fromFixedDecimal` and `fromFixedDecimalBounded`
* Many function renames, just to make sure they all follow the same convention.
* Fix `RoundHalfUp` algorithm
* Addition of `RoundHalfDown` and `RoundHalfEven`
